<p>
The source code for this service is available on <a href="https://github.com/mchung94/pyramid-service">GitHub</a>.
</p>

<p>
This service is designed to solve
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_(card_game)">Pyramid Solitaire</a>
games according to the rules in Microsoft Solitaire Collection:
<ul>
    <li>
        The game uses a standard 52-card deck, and only uses the numeric value
        of the cards.  Aces are always 1 and Kings are 13.
    </li>
    <li>
        28 cards are in a seven row pyramid formation with one card on top
        and seven cards on the bottom row.  Each card has two cards covering
        it from below (excluding the bottom row).  The remaining 24 cards
        are face up in a single stack called the stock pile.  There's also a
        waste pile that starts out empty.
    </li>
    <li>
        The goal of the game is to remove all 28 pyramid cards, even if there
        are still cards remaining in the stock or waste piles.
    </li>
    <li>
        Actions the player can perform using the uncovered pyramid cards and
        the top cards of the stock and waste piles:
        <ol>
            <li>Remove a pair of cards that add up to 13.</li>
            <li>Remove a King by itself since it counts as 13.</li>
            <li>If the stock pile isn't empty, draw a card from the stock pile to the waste pile.</li>
            <li>If the stock pile is empty, recycle the waste pile back into the stock pile.  This can only be done twice per game.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The Pyramid Solitaire Solver can solve the following types of challenges:
<ol>
    <li>
        Board Challenges: clear the 28 pyramid cards.  There can still be cards
        in the stock pile and waste pile.
    </li>
    <li>
        Score Challenges: reach the goal score.  For example, "Earn a score
        of 2,300."  The maximum score in a single game is 1290 so completing
        this challenge requires playing multiple games.
    </li>
    <li>
        Card Challenges: remove cards of a given rank.  For example, "Clear
        8 Queens in 2 deals."  The player can only clear up to four cards in 
        a single game so this requires multiple games as well.  If the player
        clears the board, the next deal does not count towards the 2 deal limit
        in the example.
    </li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Building a Deck</h2>
<p>
Cards are two characters, consisting of a rank followed by a suit.  Note that
a ten is a letter T, and that all ranks are uppercase, and all suits are
lowercase.
<ul>
    <li>Card ranks: A 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 T J Q K</li>
    <li>Card suits: c d h s</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Decks are strings containing each card of a standard 52-card deck, without any
whitespace or delimiters.  The service will let you know if there are missing
or duplicate cards.
</p>

<p>
An example deck string:
<code>Ac2c3c4c5c6c7c8c9cTcJcQcKcAd2d3d4d5d6d7d8d9dTdJdQdKdAh2h3h4h5h6h7h8h9hThJhQhKhAs2s3s4s5s6s7s8s9sTsJsQsKs</code>
</p>
<p>
The above deck string represents a game like this where the 3h is the top of
the stock pile and the Ks is the bottom of the stock pile.
<pre>
            Ac
          2c  3c
        4c  5c  6c
      7c  8c  9c  Tc
    Jc  Qc  Kc  Ad  2d
  3d  4d  5d  6d  7d  8d
9d  Td  Jd  Qd  Kd  Ah  2h
3h 4h 5h 6h 7h 8h 9h Th Jh Qh Kh As 2s 3s 4s 5s 6s 7s 8s 9s Ts Js Qs Ks
</pre>
</p>

<h2>How to use the services</h2>
After building a deck and adding the other parameters for Score and Card
challenges shown below:
<ul>
    <li>
        <em>GET [challenge request URI]</em> can retrieve a solution for the
        game if it already solved the game and the solution exists in the
        database.  The results can be:
        <ul>
            <li>
                If the solution exists, the status code 200 (OK) and JSON for
                the solution details will be returned.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the solution doesn't exist, the status code 404 (Not Found)
                will be returned.  At this point you can POST the challenge to
                be solved (described next).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>POST [challenge request URI]</em> will submit a challenge to be
        solved.  It follows the process described by
        <a href="https://farazdagi.com/2014/rest-and-long-running-jobs/">REST and long-running jobs</a>.
        The results can be:
        <ul>
            <li>
                If the solution exists already, the status code 200 (OK) and JSON
                for the solution will be returned.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the solution doesn't exist, the status code 202 (Accepted) and
                JSON including a link to check on the progress will be returned.
                The link will look something like /pyramid-solitaire/solver/tasks/{id}.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>GET [task URI]</em> is given when POSTing a challenge.  The results
        can be:
        <ul>
            <li>
                If it hasn't finished calculating the solution, the status code
                200 (OK) will be returned along with JSON indicating the
                solution is still pending.
            </li>
            <li>
                If it has finished calculation the solution, the status code
                303 (See Other) will be returned along with a link to see the
                solution.  Browsers may automatically redirect to the new link
                and return the solution.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Board Challenges</h2>
The Board Challenge will try to find a way to clear the board in the fewest
steps possible.  If it's not possible, then it will have a solution that
basically says to ask for a new deal.
<p>
<em>/pyramid-solitaire/solver/board?deck=...</em>
</p>
<p>
<form action="/pyramid-solitaire/solver/board" method="get">
    Deck: <input type="text" name="deck"><br/>
    <button type="submit">GET solution</button><br/>
    <button type="submit" formmethod="post" formtarget="_blank">POST unsolved challenge</button>
</form>
</p>

<h2>Score Challenges</h2>
When the request just contains a deck, without goalScore and currentScore, it
will just try to maximize the score.  Otherwise the solver knows the solution
should stop when it reaches the goal.
<p>
<em>/pyramid-solitaire/solver/score?deck=...</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>/pyramid-solitaire/solver/score?goalScore=1290&amp;currentScore=0&amp;deck=...</em>
</p>
<p>
<form action="/pyramid-solitaire/solver/score" method="get">
    Deck: <input type="text" name="deck"><br/>
    Goal Score: <input type="text" name="goalScore"><br/>
    Current Score: <input type="text" name="currentScore"><br/>
    <button type="submit">GET solution</button><br/>
    <button type="submit" formmethod="post" formtarget="_blank">POST unsolved challenge</button>
</form>
</p>

<h2>Card Challenges</h2>
The solver will try to find the minimum steps necessary to remove enough cards
to reach the goal.  This may return two solutions.  For example, if the goal is
to remove 4 Jacks, and there's a way to remove 2 while clearing the board and
3 while not clearing the board (requiring using one of a limited number of
re-deals), it can't decide which solution is best so it returns both.
<p>
<em>/pyramid-solitaire/solver/card?rankToRemove=J&amp;goalNumberToRemove=4&amp;currentNumberRemoved=0&amp;deck=...</em>
</p>
<p>
<form action="/pyramid-solitaire/solver/card" method="get">
    Deck: <input type="text" name="deck"><br/>
    Rank to Remove: <input type="text" name="rankToRemove"><br/>
    Goal Number of Cards to Remove: <input type="text" name="goalNumberToRemove"><br/>
    Current Number of Cards Removed: <input type="text" name="currentNumberRemoved"><br/>
    <button type="submit">GET solution</button><br/>
    <button type="submit" formmethod="post" formtarget="_blank">POST unsolved challenge</button>
</form>
